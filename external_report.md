# External evidence coverage

These are independent features, not FAL points.
A source being implemented does not mean it has successfully collected data.

| Source | Last attempt UTC | Collected | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| anilist | 2026-09-14T15:04:12.857716+00:00 | 63 | 69 | errors |
| reddit | 2026-09-14T15:06:43.279662+00:00 | 0 | 0 | paused_after_access_denial |

AniList returned no mapping (HTTP 404) for MAL IDs: 63818, 64028, 64430, 64717, 63823, 64789. Other titles were still checked.

## Limits

- AniList titles are matched by MAL ID; missing matches stay missing. Scores retain the 0–100 scale.
- AniList current franchise statistics are today's priors, not historical preseason observations.
- Reddit is a bounded sample of the latest 100 r/anime posts, limited to seven days; title matches need review. It is not a complete mention count or sentiment analysis.
- Reddit scores may be fuzzed; comments are total comments, not unique participants or MAL episode-discussion users.
- YouTube requires YOUTUBE_API_KEY. Trailer links can be discovered from AniList; channels need review before treating them as official.
- X, Google Trends, complete MAL forum participation and MAL favorites are not collected.
- Access denials pause that source. No automatic auth workaround or repeated denied requests.
